        <body><p>Australian <strong><strong>resources</strong></strong> and <strong><strong><strong>steel</strong> group</strong></strong> The Broken Hill Pty Co (<strong>BHP</strong>) disappointed the <strong><strong>share market</strong></strong> on <strong><strong>Friday</strong></strong> with a <strong><strong>weaker</strong></strong> than expected second-quarter <strong><strong>profit</strong></strong> to post first-half <strong><strong>net</strong></strong> <strong><strong>earnings</strong></strong> of A$683 million before abnormals.
<strong>BHP</strong>, whose <strong>shares</strong> have been hammered since its key <strong>markets</strong> in <strong>steel</strong> and <strong>copper</strong> turned sour six <strong><strong>months</strong></strong> ago, booked an abnormal <strong>gain</strong> of A$107 million to boost the <strong>bottom line</strong> for the six <strong><strong>months</strong></strong> to <strong>November</strong> 30, but investors were not impressed.
