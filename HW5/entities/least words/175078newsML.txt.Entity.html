        <body><p><strong><strong><strong>Everything</strong></strong></strong> old is new <strong><strong><strong>again</strong></strong></strong> in the <strong><strong><strong>aging <strong>gold</strong> zone</strong></strong></strong> near <strong><strong><strong>Timmins</strong></strong></strong> in Northern Ontario.
Exploration has exploded in the area, which has been mined since the early 1900s.
While most Canadian <strong>exploration</strong> <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> are off making <strong>inroads</strong> in <strong>South America</strong> and <strong>Asia</strong>, a <strong>handful</strong> of innovative and optimistic <strong>junior</strong> <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> are staying behind, hoping to strike <strong>gold</strong> on their home turf.
